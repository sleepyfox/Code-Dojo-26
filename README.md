Code Dojo 26
============
This is example code for the London Code Dojo's 26th meetup on September 9th, 2013. We were using the 'Workflow' kata.

Dependencies should be loaded first by running npm like so:

	npm install
	
The tests can be run from the command-line with [mocha](http://mochajs.org/):
	
	mocha --compilers coffee:coffee-script -R spec test-*.coffee

You can also use this with the **-w** flag to have mocha watch for file changes and re-run the tests (this obviates the need for watchr or similar tools).

The slides from the meeting can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/sleepyfox/code-dojo-26). You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
